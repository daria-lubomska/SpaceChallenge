# SpaceChallenge_MisssionToMars

## General info
That's my project on UDACITY, created for learning Java. In this project I built a simulation that will helps to with a mission to Mars. The mission is to send a list of items (Habitats, bunkers, food supplies, and rovers) to Mars, but is needed to run some simulations first to pick the correct fleet of rockets. 2 rocket prototypes were lready designed. This simulate helps to decide which type to use.
